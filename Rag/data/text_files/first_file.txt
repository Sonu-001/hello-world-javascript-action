Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability and allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code compared to other languages.
Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. It has a large standard library that provides a wide range of modules and functions for various tasks, making it a versatile language for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.
